#Synacor Challenge

This is an (incomplete) solution to the [Synacor Challenge] (https://challenge.synacor.com/), a programming challenge involving building a basic VM capable of decoding and running a custom set of Assembly-style instructions.

I chose to use Ruby for my solution as a way of re-introducing myself to the language after about a year of not using Ruby for anything in production.
